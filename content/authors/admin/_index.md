I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University studying paleoclimate. I use isotopes to study Earth's past history. 

I'm interested in using data to tell a story about the world around us. Using my knowledge of climate science, data science, and data visualization I hope to help adapt our world to a changing climate. Additionally, I'm intrugied by our journey towards renewables and the feasiblity of carbon capture. 

I invite you to explore my website and get to know me and my interests. If you would like to learn more about my work, please get in touch (niloulsarvian@gmail.com)! You can also follow me on twitter (@niloulsarvian) for more updates about my research.
